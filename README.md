# First website (⁀ᗢ⁀) !!
> Here are the files of the website that I'm working on right now.
This website it's supposed to help me with some activities and stuff that I'm focusing on this year. In this way, I don't forget my goals and I allow myself to fight against procrastination.

Goals:
- Learn how to make a simple website with flask, python and other programming languages.
- Be able to make my website work ofc.
- Make daily updates.
- Last but not least, find my own website useful and well looking, to make my life way easier.
